            I'm a full-stack software engineer who cares deeply about building
            products that are{" "}
            <Typography variant={TypographyVariant.DEFAULT_BOLD}>
              both technically sound and user-friendly
            </Typography>
            . Over the past few years, I've helped scale and reinvent products
            at Censys, where I served as a senior engineer on a major rebuild of
            their flagship platform. From frontend architecture to backend
            services, I've worked across the stack to build systems that are{" "}
            <Typography variant={TypographyVariant.DEFAULT_BOLD}>
              scalable, secure, and actually enjoyable to use.

            I'm especially drawn to frontend engineering and design
            systemsâ€”anything that brings clarity, structure, and beauty to
            complex ideas. I've worked most recently with{" "}
            <Typography variant={TypographyVariant.DEFAULT_BOLD}>
              React, TypeScript, and Remix
            </Typography>
            , always with a healthy appreciation for accessibility and clean
            code.

          <Typography variant={TypographyVariant.DEFAULT}>
            Outside of work, I'm often bouldering, dialing in my perfect
            espresso shot (well... at least trying to), or hanging out with some
            friends and my pup. I'm based in Seattle (after spending 5 years in
            Michigan), and{" "}
            <Typography variant={TypographyVariant.DEFAULT_BOLD}>
              I care a lot about building inclusive, human-centered tech.
